## badoogee
The famous hit and killsound that eventually lead me to make my [random killounds pack][random_killsounds]. It still is the very first sound there with tripple the chance of being played.
The sample is from a clip of [MattchoZ].

## HL1 scientist screams
Now this is something I thought of when watching [ThatDudeKen1]. He had a hitsound of one of the Half-Life 1 scientists screaming. So I thought of mixing it up with a few more screams using the **notes** hitsound option.

## THAT'S HOW WE DO IT IN THE BUSH MATE
Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1uFiH8sUqs), I decided to go ahead and replace all of Sniper's shoting sounds with him saying exactly what the title says. It is silly but doesn't work on official Valve servers.

## vibrato music
One day I thought it would be funny if all the music of the game had this vibrato effect.
So I did exactly that. **Both .vpk files are needed** because it is a bigger mod.

## windows shutdown crits
This mod plays the Windows XP shutdown sound for every crit you hit.
A random person on Discord asked if anyone could help make this work.
I tried giving them instructions but ended up doing the work for them in under 5 minutes.
